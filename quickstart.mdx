Follow these steps to authenticate with Superior Van & Mobility and send your first ADF lead.

<Steps>
<Step title="Request your access token">
Ask your Superior Van partner contact for an access token. Send it on every request in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
</Step>

<Step title="Set your environment">
Work in sandbox first:

```bash
# Set environment variables for your tooling
export SUPERIORVAN_API_TOKEN="<your-token>"
export SUPERIORVAN_BASE_URL="https://sandbox.superiorvan.com/v1"
```

Use `https://api.superiorvan.com/v1` when you are ready for production.
</Step>

<Step title="Create your first lead (JSON)">
```bash
curl -X POST "$SUPERIORVAN_BASE_URL/leads" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERIORVAN_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requestdate": "2025-01-12T18:00:00Z",
    "vehicle": {
      "year": "2025",
      "make": "Toyota",
      "model": "Sienna",
      "comments": "Needs side-entry ramp."
    },
    "customer": {
      "firstName": "Alex",
      "lastName": "Rivers",
      "email": "alex.rivers@example.com",
      "phone": "502-555-1234"
    },
    "provider": {
      "name": "Vendor Partner"
    }
  }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Check lead status">
Use the returned `leadId` to check status updates.

```bash
curl -X GET "$SUPERIORVAN_BASE_URL/leads/lead_12345" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERIORVAN_API_TOKEN"
```
</Step>
</Steps>
