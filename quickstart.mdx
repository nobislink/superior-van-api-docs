Follow these steps to authenticate with Superior Van & Mobility and send your first ADF lead.

<Steps>
<Step title="Request your API key">
Ask your Superior Van partner contact for an API key. Send it on every request in the `x-api-key` header.
</Step>

<Step title="Set your environment">
Work in sandbox first:

```bash
# Set environment variables for your tooling
export SUPERIORVAN_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
export SUPERIORVAN_BASE_URL="https://sandbox.superiorvan.com/v1"
```

Use `https://api.superiorvan.com/v1` when you are ready for production.
</Step>

<Step title="Create your first lead (JSON)">
```bash
curl -X POST "$SUPERIORVAN_BASE_URL/leads" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SUPERIORVAN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Alex",
    "lastName": "Rivers",
    "email": "alex.rivers@example.com",
    "phone": "502-555-1234",
    "vehicleYear": "2025",
    "vehicleMake": "Toyota",
    "vehicleModel": "Sienna",
    "vehicleMiles": "12000"
  }'
```
</Step>

<Step title="Check lead status">
Use the returned `leadId` to check status updates.

```bash
curl -X GET "$SUPERIORVAN_BASE_URL/leads/lead_12345" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SUPERIORVAN_API_KEY"
```
</Step>
</Steps>
