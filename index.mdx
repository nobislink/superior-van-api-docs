## About Superior Van & Mobility

Superior Van & Mobility is the nation's largest family-owned mobility dealer, known for accessible vans, lifts, and adaptive driving equipment backed by nationwide service and support. The Partner API lets vendors securely share contacts and deal activity so Superior Van teams can respond quickly and keep both systems in sync.

## What the Partner API is for

- Send new contact or lead information captured in your apps or forms.
- Keep contact details synchronized when customers update their info.
- Create and update deals so Superior Van reps can track stage, vehicle interests, and pricing.
- Maintain a single source of truth for scheduling, financing, and follow-up.

## How it works

- Vendors send ADF leads as JSON to Superior Van via HTTPS.
- Each vendor receives an access token. Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request.
- Responses include a `leadId` you can use to check status updates.

## Access and authentication

1. Request an API key from the Superior Van partner team.
2. Use the base URL for your environment:
   - Production: `https://api.superiorvan.com/v1`
   - Sandbox: `https://sandbox.superiorvan.com/v1`
3. Send the header `x-api-key: <your key>` with every call.

## Typical vendor flow

1. Capture a lead in your system.
2. Call **Create Lead** with ADF XML to register it with Superior Van.
3. Use **Get Lead** with the returned `leadId` to see current status and notes.

Use the Quickstart to send your first request, then explore the API Reference for details and examples.
