title: 'API Overview'
description: 'Authentication, base URLs, and response patterns for the Superior Van Partner API'
---

## What this covers

Use this section to understand how to authenticate, which base URL to call, and what to expect in responses. The OpenAPI file powers the endpoint examples in this docs site.

## Base URLs

| Environment | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Production | `https://api.superiorvan.com/v1` |
| Sandbox | `https://sandbox.superiorvan.com/v1` |

## Authentication

Every request must include your vendor API key:

```http
POST /leads HTTP/1.1
Host: api.superiorvan.com
x-api-key: <your-api-key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Requests without a valid API key return `401 Unauthorized`.

## Error handling

- `400 Bad Request` — validation failed or a required field is missing.
- `401 Unauthorized` — missing or invalid `x-api-key`.
- `404 Not Found` — the referenced contact or deal does not exist.
- `409 Conflict` — a resource already exists for the provided identifiers.
- `5xx` — unexpected errors; retry with backoff or contact support.

## Endpoints in this release

- **Create Lead** — send ADF XML leads from your system to Superior Van.
- **Get Lead** — retrieve current status and notes for a submitted lead.
